# Plots of axial lengths of modifications

The project is about plotting axial lengths of modifications dependecies (contorus) based on laser pulse energy, laser beam focusing deprhs, scanning speeds and fitting the results with two-dimensional polinomial. For more details, see 'Description.pdf' file.

In order to run the code 'plots.m', download the files from 'Scanning speeds' folder. Text files contain different axial lengths of modifications depending on the increasing puslse energy (x axis) and focusing depth (y axis).

### MATLAB code:
1) Pulse energies and focusing depths are upload from files (dowload them) or set manually by arrays. 
2) Axial legths of modifications are uploaded by choosing scanning speed ('.txt.' file).
3) Contour is plotted.
4) At this step fitting process can be done (see the description below the code line 51 % FIT).
5) In order to plot fitted curve - 'fitted' parameter has to be chagned from 0 to 1 and code ran again.
6) The process is repeated with the different scanning speeds. All the plots can be seen in 'Plots.pdf' file.
