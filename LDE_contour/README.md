# Modification axial lenghts plots

The project is about plotting modification axial lengths dependecies (contorus) on laser pulse energy and laser beam focusing deprhs and fitting the results with two-dimensional polinomial. For more details, see 'Description.pdf' file.

In order to run the code 'plots.m', download the files from 'Scanning speeds' folder. Text files containes different modification axial lengths depending on the increasing puslse energy (x axis) and focusing depth (y axis).

### MATLAB code:
1) Pulse energies and focusing depths are upload from files (dowload them) or set manually by arrays. 
2) Modification axial legths are uploaded by choosing scanning speed ('.txt.' file).
3) Contour is plotted.
4) At this step fitting process can be done (see the description below the code line 51 % FIT).
5) In order to plot fitted plot fitted parameter is chagned from 0 to 1 and the plot is created.
6) The process is repeated with the different scanning speeds. All the plots can be seen in 'Plots.pdf' file.
